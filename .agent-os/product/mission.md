## Pitch

AIMS (Automated Investment Management System) is a personal portfolio management platform that helps me achieve $10k/month net income from a $600k portfolio by providing disciplined task execution, real-time portfolio tracking, and automated compliance monitoring across multiple brokerages.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Individual Investor**: Single user managing personal investment portfolio across multiple brokerages

### User Personas

**Self-Directed Investor** (35-45 years old)
- **Role:** Portfolio Manager & Trader
- **Context:** Managing $600k portfolio across Fidelity, Robinhood, and Coinbase
- **Pain Points:** Manual portfolio tracking across brokers, lack of systematic execution, difficulty maintaining discipline
- **Goals:** Achieve consistent $10k/month income, limit drawdowns to <20%, automate routine tasks

## The Problem

### Fragmented Portfolio Management

Managing investments across multiple brokerages requires constant manual tracking and reconciliation. This leads to missed opportunities and inefficient execution.

**Our Solution:** Unified dashboard with real-time data from all brokerages via SnapTrade integration.

### Lack of Systematic Execution

Without enforced discipline, emotional trading and inconsistent execution prevent achieving consistent returns.

**Our Solution:** Task-driven workflow with compliance tracking ensures systematic, disciplined execution.

### Manual Reporting and Analysis

Calculating performance metrics and generating reports across multiple accounts is time-consuming and error-prone.

**Our Solution:** Automated compliance reporting and performance tracking with real-time metrics.

## Differentiators

### Personal System Design

Unlike generic portfolio managers, AIMS is built specifically for my personal investment strategy and workflow. This results in perfect alignment with my specific needs and trading style.

### Task-Driven Discipline

Unlike traditional portfolio trackers, we enforce disciplined execution through a task management system. This results in consistent, emotion-free trading decisions.

### Real-Time Multi-Brokerage Integration
