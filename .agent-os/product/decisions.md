## 2025-01-27: Agent OS Installation

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Process
**Stakeholders:** Developer

### Decision

Installed Agent OS framework into existing AIMS codebase to provide structured development workflow and documentation standards for completing the application.

### Context

AIMS has completed Phase 1 with core features implemented and SnapTrade integration working. The application needs to be finished with authentication, real account data display, and production readiness. Agent OS provides a systematic approach to complete these remaining tasks.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Continue without framework**
   - Pros: No new tooling to learn
   - Cons: Less structured approach, potential for missed requirements

2. **Custom workflow system**
   - Pros: Tailored to specific needs
   - Cons: Time investment to create, maintain documentation

### Rationale

Agent OS provides proven patterns for systematic development, ensuring all aspects are properly documented and executed. This is particularly valuable for completing the authentication flow and achieving production readiness.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Structured approach to completing remaining features
- Clear documentation of all decisions and progress
- Systematic task execution with tracking

**Negative:**
- Initial setup time investment
- Need to follow Agent OS conventions

## 2024-11-15: SQLite for Phase 1

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Developer

### Decision

Use SQLite as the database for Phase 1 development, with planned migration to PostgreSQL for production.

### Context

Starting development of a personal investment management system that needs quick iteration and simple deployment for initial development.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **PostgreSQL from start**
   - Pros: No migration needed, full SQL features
   - Cons: More complex setup, overkill for single user

2. **NoSQL (MongoDB)**
   - Pros: Flexible schema
   - Cons: Less suitable for financial data, learning curve

### Rationale

SQLite provides zero-configuration database perfect for development and single-user deployment. SQLAlchemy ORM makes future migration straightforward.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Rapid development without database server management
- Portable data files
- Easy backup and version control

**Negative:**
- Will require migration for multi-user support
- Limited concurrent access capabilities

## 2024-12-01: SnapTrade for Brokerage Integration

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Developer

### Decision

Use SnapTrade API for real-time brokerage data integration instead of building custom scrapers or using other APIs.

### Context

Need to integrate with multiple brokerages (Fidelity, Robinhood, Coinbase) for real-time portfolio data and trade execution.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Plaid**
   - Pros: Well-known, broad financial institution support
   - Cons: Limited investment account features, no trading

2. **Custom Integration**
   - Pros: Full control, no third-party dependency
   - Cons: Massive development effort, maintenance burden

3. **Manual Data Entry**
   - Pros: Simple, no integration needed
   - Cons: Time-consuming, error-prone, not real-time

### Rationale

SnapTrade provides unified API for multiple brokerages with both data retrieval and trade execution capabilities. Their SDK simplifies integration significantly.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Single integration for multiple brokerages
- Real-time data access
- Trade execution capabilities
- Maintained by third party

**Negative:**
- Third-party dependency
- Potential API costs at scale
- Limited to supported brokerages

## 2024-12-15: Task-Driven Architecture

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Developer/User

### Decision

Build the entire application around a task management system that enforces disciplined investment execution.

### Context

Personal tendency toward emotional or impulsive trading decisions that deviate from systematic strategy. Need enforcement mechanism for discipline.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional Portfolio Tracker**
   - Pros: Simpler to build, familiar UX
   - Cons: No execution enforcement, just monitoring

2. **Automated Trading Bot**
   - Pros: Removes human emotion entirely
   - Cons: Too rigid, regulatory concerns, complex

### Rationale

Task system provides structure and discipline while maintaining human control over decisions. Creates accountability through compliance tracking.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Enforces systematic execution
- Clear audit trail of all actions
- Measurable compliance metrics
- Flexible enough for strategy changes

**Negative:**
- More complex than simple portfolio tracker
- Requires discipline to follow task system
- Additional UI/UX complexity
