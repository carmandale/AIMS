# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Drawdown Analysis
> Created: 2025-07-28
> GitHub Issue: #63
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive drawdown analysis functionality that provides real-time and historical drawdown tracking to help maintain the user goal of limiting portfolio drawdowns to <20%. This feature will integrate with the existing performance dashboard and provide critical risk management insights through visual analytics and alert systems.

## User Stories

### Real-Time Drawdown Monitoring

As a portfolio manager, I want to see real-time drawdown metrics on my dashboard, so that I can immediately identify when my portfolio is approaching or exceeding my 20% drawdown limit and take corrective action.

The system should continuously calculate and display current drawdown from peak values, showing both absolute dollar amounts and percentage drawdowns. It should integrate seamlessly with the existing performance dashboard and provide immediate visual feedback when approaching risk thresholds.

### Historical Drawdown Analysis

As an investor, I want to analyze historical drawdown patterns and recovery periods, so that I can understand my portfolio's risk characteristics and improve my risk management strategy.

The system should provide detailed historical drawdown charts showing peak-to-trough periods, recovery times, and frequency of drawdown events. This analysis helps identify patterns and validate the effectiveness of risk management rules.

### Drawdown Alerts and Compliance

As a disciplined investor, I want to receive alerts when drawdowns exceed specified thresholds, so that I can enforce my risk management discipline and prevent emotional decision-making during market stress.

The system should provide configurable alert thresholds and integrate with the existing task management system to create action items when drawdowns require attention.

3. **Drawdown Visualization** - Interactive charts showing drawdown curves and recovery periods
4. **Threshold Alerts** - Configurable alerts when drawdowns exceed specified percentages
5. **Integration with Performance Dashboard** - Seamless integration with existing analytics interface

## Out of Scope

- Predictive drawdown modeling or forecasting
- Sector-specific or asset-level drawdown analysis

## Expected Deliverable

1. Real-time drawdown metrics displayed on the performance dashboard showing current drawdown percentage and dollar amount
