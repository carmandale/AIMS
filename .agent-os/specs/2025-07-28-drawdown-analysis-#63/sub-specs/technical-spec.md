# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-28-drawdown-analysis-#63/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-28
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Real-time Calculation**: Continuously calculate drawdown from rolling high-water marks using portfolio value time series
- **Data Storage**: Store daily portfolio highs and drawdown events for historical analysis
- **Performance**: Efficient calculation algorithms that can handle real-time updates without impacting dashboard performance
- **Alert System**: Integration with existing notification/task system for threshold breaches
- **UI Integration**: Seamless integration with existing performance dashboard using established design patterns
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized drawdown charts and metrics display
- **Data Persistence**: Store drawdown snapshots for historical analysis and trending

## Approach Options

**Option A: Database-Driven Approach**
- Pros: Persistent historical data, complex queries possible, data integrity
- Cons: Database overhead, migration complexity

**Option B: In-Memory Calculation with Caching** (Selected)
- Pros: Fast real-time updates, simpler implementation, leverages existing performance infrastructure
- Cons: Historical data requires separate storage, memory usage

**Rationale:** Option B selected because the existing performance dashboard already has infrastructure for real-time calculations and caching. We can extend the existing PerformanceCalculator class and leverage the performance_snapshots table for historical data storage.

## External Dependencies

No new external dependencies required. The implementation will leverage:

- **numpy** - Already included for mathematical calculations
- **Existing PerformanceCalculator** - Extend with drawdown methods
- **Existing performance_snapshots table** - Add drawdown columns
- **Recharts** - Already included for visualization components
