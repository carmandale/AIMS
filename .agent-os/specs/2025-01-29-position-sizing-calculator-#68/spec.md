# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Position Sizing Calculator
> Created: 2025-01-29
> GitHub Issue: #68
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive position sizing calculator that helps determine optimal position sizes based on risk parameters, portfolio constraints, and various sizing methodologies to ensure disciplined risk management.

## User Stories

### Risk-Based Position Sizing

As a self-directed investor, I want to calculate position sizes based on my risk tolerance, so that I can maintain consistent risk exposure across all trades.

The user will input their account size, risk percentage per trade, entry price, and stop loss price. The calculator will determine the maximum number of shares/units to purchase while limiting the potential loss to the specified risk amount. This ensures that no single trade can cause excessive damage to the portfolio, maintaining disciplined risk management even during volatile market conditions.

### Kelly Criterion Optimization

As a systematic trader, I want to use the Kelly Criterion to optimize position sizes based on win rate and risk/reward ratios, so that I can maximize long-term portfolio growth.

The user will provide historical win rate, average win/loss ratios, and confidence levels. The calculator will apply the Kelly formula to suggest optimal position sizing that balances growth potential with drawdown protection. The system will also provide fractional Kelly options (e.g., half-Kelly) for more conservative approaches.

## Spec Scope

1. **Position Sizing API** - Backend service with multiple calculation methods and risk validation
2. **Calculator UI Component** - Interactive React component with real-time calculations
3. **Trade Ticket Integration** - Seamless integration with existing trade ticket builder
4. **Risk Validation Engine** - Pre-trade checks against portfolio rules and constraints
5. **Calculation Methods** - Support for fixed risk, Kelly criterion, and volatility-based sizing

## Out of Scope

- Automated position sizing (manual calculator only)
- Options position sizing (equity/crypto only for now)
- Multi-leg or spread calculations
- Historical backtesting of sizing methods

## Expected Deliverable

1. Functional position sizing calculator accessible from the main navigation with at least three calculation methods
2. Integration with trade ticket builder showing recommended position size based on current calculator settings
3. API endpoints that validate position sizes against portfolio risk limits before trade execution
