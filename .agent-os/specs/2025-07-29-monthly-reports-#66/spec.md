## Overview

Implement an automated monthly reporting system that generates comprehensive PDF reports with performance summaries, portfolio overviews, and risk analysis. This feature will provide professional-grade monthly reporting to track portfolio performance and maintain systematic investment discipline.

## User Stories

### Monthly Performance Review

As a self-directed investor, I want to receive comprehensive monthly reports automatically, so that I can systematically review my portfolio performance and make data-driven decisions for the following month.

**Detailed Workflow**: At month-end, the system automatically generates a PDF report containing performance metrics, portfolio allocation changes, drawdown events, trade summaries, and risk analysis. The report is stored in the system and optionally emailed to me, providing a complete monthly performance review without manual effort.

### Historical Report Archive

As a portfolio manager, I want to access and compare historical monthly reports, so that I can identify long-term trends and evaluate the effectiveness of my investment strategy over time.

**Detailed Workflow**: All monthly reports are automatically archived with easy retrieval by month/year. I can view past reports through the web interface, compare performance across different months, and track the evolution of my portfolio strategy and risk metrics.

### Automated Report Distribution

As a busy investor, I want monthly reports automatically emailed to me, so that I can stay informed about my portfolio performance even when I'm not actively using the system.

**Detailed Workflow**: The system automatically generates reports at month-end and emails them as PDF attachments. Email delivery includes a summary of key metrics in the email body, with the full detailed report attached for comprehensive review.
