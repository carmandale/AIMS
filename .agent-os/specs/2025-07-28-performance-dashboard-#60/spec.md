> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive Performance Dashboard that provides real-time portfolio analytics including returns calculation, risk metrics (Sharpe ratio, volatility), and performance visualizations with benchmark comparisons. This feature enables systematic performance tracking and decision-making for achieving the $10k/month income goal.

## User Stories

### Performance Monitoring

As a self-directed investor, I want to view comprehensive performance metrics for my $600k portfolio, so that I can track progress toward my $10k/month income goal and identify areas for improvement.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User navigates to Performance Dashboard from main navigation
2. Dashboard loads with real-time portfolio data from SnapTrade
3. User sees current performance metrics: daily/monthly/yearly returns, Sharpe ratio, volatility
4. User can compare performance against benchmarks (S&P 500, custom indices)
5. Interactive charts show performance trends over time
6. User can drill down into specific time periods or metrics

### Risk Assessment

As a portfolio manager, I want to monitor risk metrics including volatility and Sharpe ratio, so that I can ensure my portfolio maintains appropriate risk levels while pursuing returns.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User views risk metrics section of dashboard
2. Real-time volatility calculations based on recent price movements
3. Sharpe ratio calculated using risk-free rate benchmarks
4. Visual indicators show when metrics exceed acceptable thresholds
5. Historical trend analysis shows risk evolution over time

### Performance Visualization

As an investor tracking multiple strategies, I want interactive charts and visualizations of my performance data, so that I can quickly identify trends and make data-driven decisions.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User interacts with performance charts (daily, monthly, yearly views)
2. Charts update dynamically based on selected time periods
3. Comparison overlays show portfolio vs benchmark performance
4. Responsive design works across desktop and mobile devices
5. Charts integrate with existing UI design patterns

## Spec Scope

1. **Returns Calculation Engine** - Calculate daily, monthly, and yearly portfolio returns with accurate time-weighted methodology
2. **Risk Metrics Computing** - Implement Sharpe ratio and volatility calculations using real portfolio data
3. **Performance Visualization** - Create interactive charts using Recharts with multiple time period views
4. **Benchmark Comparison** - Compare portfolio performance against S&P 500 and custom benchmark indices
5. **Real-time Data Integration** - Connect to existing SnapTrade portfolio data for live performance updates

## Out of Scope

- Advanced attribution analysis (Phase 4 feature)
- Options-specific performance tracking (Phase 4 feature)
- Multi-strategy performance breakdowns (Phase 4 feature)
- Tax-adjusted performance calculations (Phase 2 should-have)
- Performance alerts and notifications (Phase 2 should-have)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Performance Dashboard** - Complete dashboard page accessible from main navigation showing all key metrics
2. **Accurate Calculations** - All performance and risk metrics calculate correctly using real portfolio data
3. **Interactive Visualizations** - Responsive charts that allow time period selection and benchmark comparison
4. **Real-time Updates** - Dashboard reflects current portfolio state and updates when positions change
