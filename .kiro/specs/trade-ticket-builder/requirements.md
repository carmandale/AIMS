# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Trade Ticket Builder is a critical component of AIMS that provides a manual execution interface with blocking task validation. This feature enables users to create, validate, and submit trade orders across multiple brokerages while ensuring compliance with the disciplined investment workflow. The Trade Ticket Builder enforces that all required pre-trade tasks are completed before allowing trade execution, providing guard rails against impulsive or non-compliant trading actions.
