# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Portfolio Tracking feature is a core component of AIMS that provides a consolidated view of investments across multiple brokerages (Fidelity, Robinhood, Coinbase). This system enables users to monitor their entire portfolio in one place, track performance metrics, analyze asset allocation, and make informed investment decisions. The Portfolio Tracking feature serves as the foundation for other AIMS components by providing accurate and up-to-date portfolio data.
