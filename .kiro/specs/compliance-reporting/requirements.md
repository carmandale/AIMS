# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Compliance Reporting feature is a critical component of AIMS that provides real-time metrics and trend analysis to ensure adherence to investment discipline and regulatory requirements. This system tracks task completion, portfolio allocation limits, trading rules, and performance metrics to identify potential compliance issues before they become problems. The Compliance Reporting feature helps maintain investment discipline, reduce risk, and ensure regulatory compliance through automated monitoring and reporting.
