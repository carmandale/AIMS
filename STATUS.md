## 🚨 **Critical Issues & Blockers**

### **1. Security Implementation** 🔒 **HIGH PRIORITY**
- **Issue**: [PR #18](https://github.com/carmandale/AIMS/pull/18) - Security vulnerabilities in Portfolio API
- **Status**: Open PR with JWT authentication, user management, rate limiting
- **Impact**: Blocks production deployment
- **Action Required**: Review and merge security PR

### **2. SnapTrade Integration** 📊 **HIGH PRIORITY**
- **Issue**: [#24](https://github.com/carmandale/AIMS/issues/24) - Implement Real Data Integration
- **Status**: Service implemented but not connected to API/Frontend
- **Current State**: 
  - ✅ SnapTrade service fully implemented (`src/services/snaptrade_service.py`)
  - ✅ SDK integrated (`snaptrade-python-sdk==11.0.114`)
  - ❌ No API endpoints exposing SnapTrade functionality
  - ❌ Portfolio service still uses mock fetchers
  - ❌ No frontend integration
- **Impact**: System uses mock data, preventing real investment decisions

### **3. Test Suite Stability** ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
- **Status**: 11 failed tests, 11 errors (mainly database index conflicts)
- **Impact**: CI pipeline instability
- **Action Required**: Fix SQLite test database issues

## 💡 **Recommendations**

1. **Focus on Security PR** - This is the biggest blocker for production use
2. **Prioritize SnapTrade API endpoints** - The service is ready, just needs API exposure
3. **Create issue cleanup sprint** - Many issues appear to be completed but not closed
4. **Establish regular status updates** - Update this document weekly
