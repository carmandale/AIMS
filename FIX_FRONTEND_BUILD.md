# Fix Frontend Build - Action Required

The CI is failing because `frontend/src/lib/` files are not in the repository. They exist on your local machine but are being ignored by git.

## To fix this, run these commands:

```bash
# Force add the lib files (they're currently gitignored)
git add -f frontend/src/lib/api-client.ts frontend/src/lib/utils.ts

# Commit them
git commit -m "Add missing frontend lib files to fix CI"

# Push
git push
```

## Why this happened:

1. The `.gitignore` had `lib/` which was ignoring ALL lib directories
2. I've already fixed the `.gitignore` to use `/lib/` (only root lib)
3. But the files were already ignored, so they need to be force-added

Once you run these commands, the CI should pass.
