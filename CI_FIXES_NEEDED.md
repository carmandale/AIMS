# CI/CD Pipeline Fixes Required

## Issues Fixed
- ✅ **Frontend dependency conflict**: Updated `cmdk` from `1.0.0` to `^1.0.4` for React 19 compatibility
- ✅ **Package manager inconsistency**: Project specifies `yarn@1.22.22` but CI environment lacks yarn

## Required CI/CD Updates
The following changes need to be applied to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

### 1. Rename backend job
```yaml
jobs:
  test-backend:  # changed from 'test'
```

### 2. Add frontend testing job
```yaml
  test-frontend:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [20.x, 22.x]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    
    - name: Enable Corepack
      run: corepack enable
    
    - name: Cache yarn packages
      uses: actions/cache@v4
      with:
        path: |
          ~/.yarn/cache
          frontend/.yarn/cache
          frontend/node_modules
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-yarn-${{ hashFiles('frontend/yarn.lock') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-yarn-
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      working-directory: ./frontend
      run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile
    
    - name: Lint
      working-directory: ./frontend
      run: yarn lint
    
    - name: Type check
      working-directory: ./frontend
      run: yarn build
    
    - name: Format check
      working-directory: ./frontend
      run: yarn format:check
```

## Why These Changes Are Needed
1. **Frontend testing was missing**: The CI only tested Python backend code
2. **Yarn support required**: The project uses yarn but CI doesn't have it configured
3. **Dependency conflicts**: The cmdk package had peer dependency issues with React 19

## Branch Status
The branch `claude/issue-3-20250717-0955` is now ready to merge once CI passes. The dependency fix has been applied and pushed.
